<h2>Circuits using 555 IC</h2>

<h3> Astable Circuit </h3>
   
*    An astable 555 circuit continuously charges and discharges a capacitor through two resistors, never settling into a stable state. This repeating charge and discharge cycle forces the output to oscillate indefinitely, creating a square wave.
*    The rate of discharge is controlled by the RC delay. By using a potentiometer or a trimmer, we can adjust the R and therefore adjust the frequency of the Square wave.
